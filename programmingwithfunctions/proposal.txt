Significant Program Proposal:

A program that reads a text file and counts how often each word occurs in the file.

1. What is the title of your program?
    My program will be named countwords

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    This will help me find out how many of each word is in a text file. This will help me to proofread my papers 
    for English class by showing me if I use a word or a phrase too much in my writing!

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    I think that I will learn how to develop my own functions, while also making test functions at the same time.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
    My program will use text files and pytest. Possibly more but those are the only ones I can think of right now!

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    Yes

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
    Yes

I started making a text file with information so that I can use my functions to count those words. 
I also started making a function with a for loop to go through each word to count how many times it is in the 
text file! Next week I will work more on my function and will make the test function!
