1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I think functions are way cool. They help to avoid repetition in your code, which definitely helps it to be more efficient
and fast. I really liked our project on adding area codes to a list of phone numbers. I think that could be really 
helpful in the real world. I also liked when we had to design within a program to make a picture. I thought it was 
interesting to learn more about how to repeat certain items and where each pixel would be placing certain colors or
items.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
I honestly do not like test functions. I think that they are useful in finding bugs throughout your code by testing 
each function individually, but they are still a bit confusing for me. I just learned that test functions only work
on return statements, so they will not work if you just print your output, instead of returning it. That makes things
a little harder to make test functions. I do think that it would be useful for a very large document, which we have
not had to deal with in this class so once I get there, I am sure I will begin to like them more and more to help find
bugs in my programs!


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I am honestly not very good at troubleshooting. I do know that I can use my debugger to find what each of my variables
are being inputed as to make sure they are what I want them to be. I also think that I have a tendancy to move my if 
statements around in my for loops until the work how I want them to. Working on learning more about how to use for loops
with if statements would help me to spend less time on troubleshooting and more time on making my code work more 
efficiently.
