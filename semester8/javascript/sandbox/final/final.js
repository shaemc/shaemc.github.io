// Requirements:
// 1.  Create html, css, and js files for final project
// 2.	Create a json file with different meals
// 3.	Create a button to click and filter through the json file and randomly select a meal for one day
// 4.	Place that meal into a calendar (weekly?) for that day, within the js file add it by using innerHTML?
// 5.	Go back and click the button for each of the rest of the 7 days

// Stretch challenge:
// 1.	Connect your json file with the usda food api (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html ) and write down all of the ingredients that you would need for each meal
// 2.	Place those ingredients in the calendar under the meal (or possibly create a grocery list on the side of the calendar to show what you would need to buy in order to make that meal!)



// Your project should include application of most of the topics introduced in the course. 
// ***If you want to show your prowess in pulling JSON data from a remote site, like you did in week 5, a good choice would be to use mocky.io to store your JSON data and serve it up. The mocky.io service stores your JSON data and provides you with a URL that you can use to retrieve it in your code.
// 1.	It should be written in Javascript! (With some HTML/CSS for the user interface)
// 2.	It should show some level of organization: at a minimum it should have more than one function.
// 3.	It should include DOM interaction: select an element, modify it, and listen for and react to events
// 4.	It should show examples of conditional branching
// 5.	At least one of the following should be used:
//          Fetch
//          Objects
//          Modules
//          Arrays and array method usage (forEach, map, reduce, filter, etc)
